My name is Andrew Hasler and I bring to the table these skills:Professional attention to detail, group initiatve and team development, applied experience and deeply intricate dance styling. 

- I rock a twelve string and onewheel 
- I have background in snow sports, hospitality, physical and digital applied statistics, data wrangling and western literature. 

 I have been involved with the tech world for nearly 3 weeks and am progressing with the industry as fast as it is changing. I come from a land down under. 

### my history
 I spent most of my work histroy in and around the mountain industry. Ski resort operations has been my focus for more than a decade and has allowed me the ability to travel. My experience in the resort industry includes but is not limited too: Lift Operation, Terrain park Managment, Mountain Safety and Snowboard Instruction. Corporations I have worked for include: Vail Resorts, Intrawest Ski Corporation, Ceasers Entertainment and Edgewood Reality.

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHW1oY26kxQ]and it will answer **all** your questions.
